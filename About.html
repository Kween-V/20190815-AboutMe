		<h4>About Me</h4>
		<h5>A little something about me</h5>
		<p id="p1">My name is Victoria, was born in 1998, on June 15th. I was born and raised in Hong Kong. I was sent to Canada when I had just turned 15, to study grade 10 in a private international school in Niagara, right by border. I lived on school residence thorughout my high school time, graduated in June 2016 with two business/ academic scholarships and a couple atheletic awards. Same year, moved on to study Management and Art double majors in University of Toronto, joint program with Sheridan College.<p>
		<p id="p1">In my opinion, it is better to know a lot of things than to be really good at one thing but know nothing else, that might just be because of my personal interest. I enjoy learning new things and always looking for opportunity to learn new skills, gain new knowledge. When I was young, my weeks are always packed with classes and tutors, including figur skating, gymnastic, ballet, piano, violin, swimming, vlleyball, soccer, track, cross-country, badminton, etc. Although, I was lucky enough to be able to hang on to my favourite activity even in university - volleyball.<p>

		<h6>Passion</h6>
		<p id="p2">I went to an art and sport specialist school when I was in Hong Kong, from the moment you apply for the school, you have got to be either really good at art or really good at sport. I was an art student. Therefore, when I got onto the volleyball team in grade 7, I was not given as much attention as my teammates were getting, nor was I trained properly since they were all club player if not on the national team. Hence, when I got to Canada, I took my chance and self-taught through youtube videos and volleyball website, and my hard work paid off as I was able to take on the role as co-captain for my highschool team. Then been on the University of Toronto women volleyball d-league as a libero for over 3 years. The path to getting what you want is never easy.</p>
		<p id="p2">When I was in grade 8-9, I had started an online shop on instagram, something like the dropshipping industry that is trending in recent society, even though I was very young, I managed the small business all by myself, from supplies ,to finance, to delivery, and to customer service, etc. Some might say I was silly, but not only I earned a couple extra bucks off that, most importantly, I took the risk to start the business when I still had to luxury to be able to throw in my all without affecting my life as I was still depending on my parents at that age. Unfortunatly, I had to shut down my store just after about 2 years because I came to Canada. In highschool while living on residence I was able to do some small business here and there such as selling chinese instant noodles (for example: I buy indomie by boxes, $12 for 30packs then I sell them for $10/pack). In university, there were friends that kept asking me to join them for business, but to me, having the right business partner is very important, and I would rather not have anything or even work alone than to have the not so perfect business partner. In the past year(2019), I have been planning and sourcing to start 2 of my major projects, one is my personal fashion brand, the other is a lash extension studio. *Fun Fact: My lash studio is opening in 2 weeks!* Let's all wish me a very good luck and come get lashes done by me :)</p>
